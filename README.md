This project is inspired by the “Chai Aur Code” YouTube channel and aims to present the channel’s content on an interactive and professional website. Users can easily explore videos, subscribe, and follow coding tutorials.

The website is built using Next.js to ensure it is fast, SEO-friendly, and responsive while following modern web standards.

In this series, the instructor gave API challenges to make users go beyond just copying tutorials.

I have completed all the assigned challenges successfully.

The tasks involved hitting two APIs: one for sending messages and one for suggesting messages.

I handled message validation, dynamic username extraction, and streaming responses.

All responses were processed and displayed correctly using proper string manipulation.

I used Groq’s free API to complete the assignment and test the flows.
